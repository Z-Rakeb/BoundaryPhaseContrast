## G4BoundaryPhaseContrast


This set of codes was written in **C++** to develop the Monte Carlo **Gate** simulation tool based on **Geant4**.


## Description


Given the advantages and performance of **X-ray phase contrast** imaging, the possibility of simulation is important.
Despite the possibility of simulating this imaging method using the Monte Carlo Gate simulation tool, the presence of defects, including the lack of support for complex geometry, motivated the development of a code to eliminate these defects.


## Instructions


-- Add the *'.cc'* files to the *gate installation path/source/physics/src/src*.
-- Add the *'.hh'* files to the *gate installation path/source/physics/src/include*.
-- Remake the Gate
